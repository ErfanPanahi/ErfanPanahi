### Hello my dear friend 👋
#### Welcome to my GitHub account!

🎓 I am a senior undergraduate electrical engineering (⚡🖥️) student at the University of Tehran.   

💻 I am really attracted to the field of signal processing and its branches.

📶 One of the other fields which I am really interested in is wireless communications.

🧠 It is better to mention that I really like to use artificial intelligence tools in the fields mentioned above.
